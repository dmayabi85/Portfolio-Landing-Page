    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have a background in Computer Science and have worked as a software developer for several years. I decided to
        take a class on programming to continue improving my skills and stay up to date with the latest developments in
        the field.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading about emerging technology, playing video games, and learning about artificial
        intelligence. My current skills include web development, machine learning, and data analysis.</p>
