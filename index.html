            <p>I have a background in Computer Science and have worked as a software developer for several years. I decided to
                take a class on programming to continue improving my skills and stay up to date with the latest developments in
                the field.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading about <em><strong>emerging technology</em></strong>, playing video games, and
                learning about artificial
                intelligence. My current skills include web development, machine learning, and data analysis.</p>
